ClairiÃ¨re, a rust implementation of implicit interval tree with interpolation index.

This is a reimplementation/huge inspiration of [lh3 cgranges](https://github.com/lh3/cgranges) and [mlin iitii](https://github.com/mlin/iitii/), but with parallelisation of algorithm.

Naming: *ClairiÃ¨re* is the French word for glade, an interval between trees.

## Use

Add this in your Cargo.toml
```
clairiere = { git = "https://github.com/natir/clairiere.git" }
```

For information on how to build the different intervals tree, understand their differences and parameters you can consult the [online manual](https://natir.github.io/clairiere/usage.html) and check the [examples](https://github.com/natir/clairiere/tree/main/examples).

Feature:
- parallel: activate parallel code
- bench: makes some function and method public, this feature is necessary to launch benchmarks
- eval_guess: a feature to let clairiere write in stdout some metrics usefull for algorithm evaluation
