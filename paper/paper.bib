    abstract = "{We present bedtk, a new toolkit for manipulating genomic intervals in the BED format. It supports sorting, merging, intersection, subtraction and the calculation of the breadth of coverage. Bedtk uses implicit interval tree, a data structure for fast interval overlap queries. It is several to tens of times faster than existing tools and tends to use less memory.The source code is available at https://github.com/lh3/bedtk.}",
